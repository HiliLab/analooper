Test data can be downloaded from the NIH Small Reads Archive at:
http://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi?run=SRR1613972

The settings that were used for PE_BASH_MAKER.py are as follows:

Read length --rlength 101 
Minimum family size  --min 3
Maximum family size  --max 1000
Consensus cutoff=0.7  --cut 0.7
N Cutoff  --Ncut 0.3
read Types used in consensus making  --read_type dpm
Filters used  --filt os

This is a mouse sample.  The reference was the mm10.fasta from UCSC

The peak family size plot can be derived from the resulting *.tagstat
file.
Plot the first column as the X-axis vs the 2nd column on the y-axis. The
final plot for the test data can be seen in PeakFamilySize.png

The countmuts file was generated with a minimum depth of 50, a minimum 
clonality of 0 and a maximum clonality of .02.
